Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), respirations are 15/min, pulse is 67/min, and blood pressure is 122/98 mm Hg. Physical exam is unremarkable. However, a CT scan of the abdomen shows a calcified mass near her gallbladder. Which of the following diagnoses should be excluded first in this patient?\", \"answer\": \"Gallbladder cancer\", \"options\": {\"A\": \"Acute cholecystitis\", \"B\": \"Gallbladder cancer\", \"C\": \"Choledocholithiasis\", \"D\": \"Pancreatitis\", \"E\": \"Duodenal peptic ulcer\"}, \"meta_info\": \"step2&3\", \"answer_idx\": \"B\"}\n","{\"question\": \"A 7-year-old boy is brought to his pediatrician’s office for a follow-up visit. He was diagnosed with asthma when he was 3 years old and has since been on treatment for the condition. He is currently on a β-agonist inhaler because of exacerbation of his symptoms. He has observed that his symptoms are more prominent in springtime, especially when the new flowers are blooming. His mother has a backyard garden and whenever he goes out to play there, he experiences chest tightness with associated shortness of breath. He has been advised to take more precaution during this seasonal change and to stay away from pollen. He is also being considered for an experimental therapy, which attenuates the activity of certain mediators which cause his asthmatic attack. The targeted mediator favors the class switching of antibodies. A reduction in this mechanism will eventually reduce the exaggerated response observed during his asthmatic attacks, even when exposed to an allergen. Which of the following mediators is described in this experimental study?\", \"answer\": \"IL-4\", \"options\": {\"A\": \"IL-5\", \"B\": \"IL-2\", \"C\": \"IL-10\", \"D\": \"IL-13\", \"E\": \"IL-4\"}, \"meta_info\": \"step2&3\", \"answer_idx\": \"E\"}\n","{\"question\": \"A 3-month-old boy is brought the emergency department by his parents after an episode of cyanosis and muscle hypotonia that resolved after 2 minutes. Diagnostic evaluation fails to discover an exact etiology of the boy's symptoms and the episode is classified as a brief resolved unexplained event (BRUE). The risk profile for BRUE in infants remains largely unknown. The pediatrician who saw the boy in the emergency department is trying to identify risk factors for BRUE. She is aware of several confounders, including age, socioeconomic background, and family history of medical illness. She recruits 75 infants under 1 year of age with BRUE and 75 infants without BRUE of the same age, socioeconomic background, and family history of medical illness. She then compares the two groups with regard to history of feeding problems and history of recent upper respiratory infection. Which of the following methods was conducted to control confounding bias in the study?\", \"answer\": \"Matching\", \"options\": {\"A\": \"Stratified analysis\", \"B\": \"Blinding\", \"C\": \"Restriction\", \"D\": \"Randomization\", \"E\": \"Matching\"}, \"meta_info\": \"step2&3\", \"answer_idx\": \"E\"}\n","{\"question\": \"A 29-year-old man presents to the emergency department due to central chest pain over the past 3 days which is constant and unrelated to exertion. The pain is sharp, severe, increases when lying down, and improves with leaning forward. The pain also radiates to his shoulders and neck. The patient has no past medical history. He has smoked 10 cigarettes per day for the past 7 years and occasionally drinks alcohol. He presents with vital signs: blood pressure 110/70 mm Hg, regular radial pulse of 95/min, and temperature 37.3°C (99.1°F). On physical exam, a scratching sound of to-and-from character is audible over the left sternal border at end-expiration with the patient leaning forward. His chest X-ray is normal and ECG is shown in the picture. Which of the following is the optimal therapy for this patient?\", \"answer\": \"Ibuprofen + colchicine +/- omeprazole\", \"options\": {\"A\": \"Indomethacin +/- omeprazole\", \"B\": \"Ibuprofen + colchicine +/- omeprazole\", \"C\": \"Prednisone + colchicine\", \"D\": \"Pericardiocentesis\", \"E\": \"Pericardiectomy\"}, \"meta_info\": \"step2&3\", \"answer_idx\": \"B\"}\n","{\"question\": \"A 46-year-old man is brought to the emergency department for evaluation of altered mental status.
