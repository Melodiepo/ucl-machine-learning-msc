# COMP0171: Bayesian Deep Learning

This repo contains coursework, lecture materials, and exercises for COMP0171 Bayesian deep learning. 

## Repository Structure

### `coursework-1`
This folder contains materials for the first coursework assignment, which covers topics such as Bayesian classifiers and regression using probabilistic frameworks.

#### Contents:
- `(Part 1) Seven scientists.ipynb`: A notebook exploring Bayesian modeling with a real-world example involving scientific data.
- `(Part 2) Bayesian classifiers.ipynb`: Implementation and analysis of Bayesian classifiers.
- `data.pt`: Dataset used in the coursework.

### `coursework-2`
This folder contains materials for the second coursework assignment, focusing on uncertainty quantification and deep generative models such as variational autoencoders (VAEs).

#### Contents:
- `(Part 1) Uncertainty quantification.ipynb`: Implementation of methods for estimating model uncertainty.
- `(Part 2) Variational auto-encoder.ipynb`: Implementation and analysis of a variational autoencoder.
- `two_moons.pt`: Dataset used in the coursework.

### `lecture-notes-official`
This folder contains lecture slides provided for the module. The notes cover key topics in Bayesian deep learning, including:
- Monte Carlo methods and sampling techniques
- Variational inference and optimization
- Model comparison and uncertainty quantification
- Gaussian processes and sequence models
- Deep learning applications (e.g.GNNs) with Bayesian principles
- Bayesian optimization and active learning

### `weekly-exercises-w-sols`
This folder contains weekly exercises and their solutions, designed to reinforce the concepts taught in the lectures. (WIP)

#### Contents:
- `1. Jupyter-introduction.ipynb`: Introductory notebook for setting up and using Jupyter notebooks.
- `2. Bent-Coins-Demo.ipynb`: Demonstration of probabilistic modeling using a coin-toss example.
- `6. MNIST-Classification-Examples.ipynb`: Practical examples of classification using the MNIST dataset.
- `7. GPs and NNs.ipynb`: Exploration of Gaussian processes and their connections to neural networks.

WIP: My own lecture notes, exam cheatsheet, complete weekly tutorials with solutions.
