# COMP0078: Supervised Learning

This repo contains all relevant materials for COMP0078 Supervised Learning, including official lecture notes, my own notes, courseworks, weekly tutorials.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

### `coursework-1`
This folder contains materials and implementations for the first coursework assignment, which focuses on supervised learning methods such as linear regression, k-nearest neighbors, and kernelized ridge regression. 

#### Contents:
- `1.1-linear-regression.ipynb`: Implementation of a linear regression model.
- `1.2-filtered-boston-housing-analysis.ipynb`: Analysis of the Boston housing dataset.
- `1.3-kernelised-ridge-regression.ipynb`: Implementation of ridge regression using kernel methods.
- `2.1-k-nearest-neighbors.ipynb`: Implementation of the k-nearest neighbors algorithm.
- `Boston-filtered.csv`: Preprocessed Boston housing dataset used in the analysis.
- `comp0078-cw1-question.pdf`: Assignment brief for Coursework 1.
- `comp0078-cw1-report.pdf`: Submitted report for Coursework 1.

### `coursework-2`
This folder contains materials and implementations for the second coursework assignment, which delves into kernel-based classification methods, including one-vs-all and one-vs-one strategies.

#### Contents:
